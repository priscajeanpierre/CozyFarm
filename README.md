When you run the Cozy Farm Game you will be prompted to select a character and once you do that will be who you
play in the game. Once you're in the game the first map will be an outdoor farming map. On this map this is where harvesting
is supposed to happen but unfortunately it does not work right now. Basically on the map there are 
rows of little dirt circles and that is where you would plant/harvest and you would do so by moving the character towards the plots
until it is right on top and then you would press the E key to harvest but it does not register. To keep track of information in game, I have 
drawn on an inventory for Crops harvested in the corner of the screen and also a trakcer for the player position
and tile the player is on so that it is easier to find the point where you can harvest. To transition to the next map you will go through the
door if the player house in the top left corner and this will take you to the interior map and this is where you would use the crops you harvested
that are in your inventory to create recipes but pressing the C key for craft but since the harvesting doesnt work if you try to craft a recipe it will
tell you that you are missing items. In order to travel to the third map you have to interact with the npc in the bottom left corner in the bedroom and it will take you outside to a winter version of the fall farm. This is where you would do the debris removal by removing the snow off trees but i did not have time to get to that. :(
