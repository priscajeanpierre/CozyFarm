When you run the Cozy Farm Game you will be prompted to select a character and once you do that will be who you play in the game. Once you're in the game the first map will be an outdoor farming map. On this map this is where harvesting happens and the playable farming area is the farming patch with only the tomatoes and the three dirt plots that is in front of the player house but before the animal area. You can harvest tomatoes by pressing E and it will add it your inventory which is in the top left corner of the screen. 

To transition to the next map you will go through the door if the player house in the top left corner and this will take you to the interior map and this is where you would use the crops you harvested
that are in your inventory to create recipes by pressing the C key once you are in the kitchen areas and every time you use materials the amount of crops in your inventory will decrease.

In order to travel to the third map you have to interact with the npc in the bottom left corner in the bedroom and it will take you outside to a winter version of the fall farm. This is where you would do the debris removal by removing the snow off trees and the trees that are made for debris removal are all the trees in the bottom right area near the market. You can remove debris by pressing the E key.
